# Nuxt Vuex Auth Sample

This was meant to be my place to learn Nuxt + Vuex + Auth, but days went by and most people ask how to create an auth system without using @nuxt/auth (as I normally would do). So here it is, I refactored it a few months since I began this repository to create a working app with my style of writing code as of now.

If you want to steal things here and there, you're allowed. If you want to run it on your machine, you will need Node v14 installed first.

## Build Setup
```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
